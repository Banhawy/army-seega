# army-seega
This is a web-based offilne board game app I made while I was in the army to play with my peers, since we didnt have internet access or any installed games.

Project is written in Vuejs. Open `index.js` from any browser and it should just work.

This is my first Vue project, kinda learned it as I went from offline docs. Don't expect to see best Vuejs practices implemented here.
