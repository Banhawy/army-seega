# army-seega
This is a web-based offilne board game app I made while I was in the army to play with my peers, since we didn't have internet access or any installed games.

To my knowledge, this is an *ancient* Egyptian game that goes back to age of the Pharaohs. 

It is commonly played these days by Egyptian soldiers using stones and lines drawn in the sand.

Project is written in Vuejs. Open `index.html` from any browser and it should just work.

This is my first Vue project, kinda learned it as I went from offline docs. Don't expect to see best Vuejs practices implemented here.
